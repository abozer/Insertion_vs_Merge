Implementations for Insertion Sort and Merge Sort in C++.

input.txt contains the number of elements to be read in the first line and 100000 random integer entries to be sorted.
output.txt is the output of ascending sorting using both algorithms.

The program outputs the running time comparison of the two algorithms for given number of elements.
